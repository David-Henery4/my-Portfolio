# My Developer Portfolio

"This is my front end developer portfolio"

This website is for people to know a little bit about me, display my current skill set and also show my projects. Aswell as a way for potential employers to contact me. If your curious and want to check it out, follow this link:  https://www.djhwebdevelopment.com

## Design, colour theme & layout

This portfilio has a minimalistic type layout, with a kind of monochrome type colour scheme with an accent colour used to create hierarchy to help guide the user thoughout the site.

The layout of the site is designed to go in order of importance. Starting with the **header** to display what the site is about. Then the **about** section to let users know a little bit about myself. The **skills** section, in order to let future employers know exactly what my skills are and what i can bring. A **projects** sections, to help display these skills and showcase my capability. Finally a **contact** section for potential employers to get in touch if they like my portfolio.

## Technologies used

The main technologies used were:

- Javascript
- CSS/Sass
- HTML
- Parcel
- Git

**Javascript** was mainly used for the providing functionality to the mobile navigation aswell as the burger icon animation. 

It was also used to render different project details data to the modal when a specific link was clicked. I done this by creating a view module for every project, then based on what link the user clicked the relevent project data would then be rendered to the modal. This saved me from having to create multple different modals.

**HTML** was used for the structure of the elements, while **CSS/Sass** were used for the styling and layout of the overall site, aswell as being used to provide the animations to the hero section.

while i used **git** for my version control and then created a live connection to my **gitHub** so i would have both a local & online repo for my portfolio. I did this so my project would always have a version to go back to if any major errors ocurred.

Then **Parcel** was used as my bundler to make sure my files were fully compiled and ready to be made live. It also made sure that modern features, like ES6 features, were made backwards compatiable and were ready for use on older browsers.

## Improvements to be added

Although im happy with the outcome of my current portfolio, i always feel that improvements can be made. As i update this portfolio over time there are few improvements that i will try to implement.

* A light/dark theme so that users can choose they preference when viewing the site.

* Subtle transition animations on the page section on the first viewing to bring the static section more to life and more visually appealing. 

* A custom confirmation message on the contact form submit so users are not redircted to a thank you page.

* A logo re-design to make it more visually pleasing and eye-catching.
